<title>Image Selection Dialog</title>

<para>
Upon opening of the plugin from the host application the <emphasis>Images</emphasis>  window will appear with your 
pre-selected images already in the list to be sent. With the <guilabel>Add Images</guilabel> button a file browser 
opens to add more files as needed in the usual file selection manner. The image under the cursor in the list is displayed on the right side. 
</para>

<tip><para>
You can use drag and drop capability between the host application window and the image file list for add new 
items to e-mail.
</para></tip>

<para>
When clicking on the second button <guilabel>Remove Images</guilabel> the selected images (highlighted in the list) 
will be removed from the send list.
</para>

<para>
When you have finished selecting your files, click <guilabel>OK</guilabel> to open the 'new e-mail' dialog window 
of your favorite e-mail client. You just need to add the addressee and the subject. The selected images will be already there as attachments. 
</para>

<warning><para>
Be sure not to overload your own or your addresses e-mail transmission limit, most providers limit the e-mail 
size to some megabytes of data. Use several e-mails if you want to send a lot of data.
</para></warning>

<title>Mail Dialog</title>

<para>
The mail dialog is used to change the settings of the images to be sent. These settings will be remembered when you close the plugin until you change them.
</para>

<para>
Select your favorite e-mail client from the drop-down menu. (If you use <application>Thunderbird</application>, the field below will be available to select the correct path according to your installation).
</para>

<note><para>
If you want to use GMail service, you need to install <application>GMailAgent</application> in your computer, available at <ulink url="http://gmailagent.sourceforge.net">this url</ulink>.
</para></note>

<para>
If you select <guilabel>Add Comments in the Attached File</guilabel> the comments included with the images will be merged to a text file and attached in the mail.
</para>

<para>
The next 3 items allow you to set-up the image quality to be sent. Select one of those. The <guilabel>New Images Compression</guilabel> ratio can be chosen with the slider or the value box. 75% is a standard compression ratio for <guilabel>JPEG</guilabel> files. Setting compression to 100% will result in a lossless compression at the cost of the largest file size. The difference in file size between 90% and 100% can be quite dramatic, whereas the gain in quality is minor. Very good quality is already obtained with 85% compression.
</para>

<para>
The <guilabel>PNG</guilabel> format on <guilabel>New Images Format</guilabel> drop-down menu is not well adapted to reduce photographic images file size, but it is best suited for compressing lossless items like TIFF file format. <guilabel>PNG</guilabel> must be used if you use a speed internet dialup and if you want preserved the photo quality. Else, <guilabel>JPEG</guilabel> is the recommended format.
</para>

<note><para>
If you choose <guilabel>JPEG</guilabel> as <guilabel>New Images Format</guilabel> and if the original files were in <guilabel>JPEG</guilabel> format, then the original Exif data included is preserved in e-mailed images.
</para></note>
